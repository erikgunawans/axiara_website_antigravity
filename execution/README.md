# Execution Scripts

Deterministic Python scripts that handle the actual work.

Guidelines:
- Each script should do **one thing well**
- Use environment variables from `.env` for API keys and secrets
- Comment thoroughly — these are the system's reliable workhorses
- All scripts should be testable independently
- Handle errors gracefully and return clear exit codes

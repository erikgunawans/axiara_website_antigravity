## Content Rules

1. Never invent claims. Every statistic (99.9%, 100%, 30 days, Level 5) 
   must come from the manual.
2. Preserve the voice: sovereign, precise, authoritative. Not salesy.
3. Use direct quotes from the manual for pillar descriptions and key 
   differentiators — these are deliberate formulations, not paraphrases.
4. The Axiara Accuracy Standard formula (A = (T_correct - T_hallucination) 
   / T_total × 100 ≥ 99.9%) can be displayed on the technology pages.
5. For industry pages, use the exact "Strategic Pain Point" and 
   "E2E Entry Thesis" language from Section 1.4.

## Voice Guidelines

- Do: "We assign a human Logic Owner to every automated decision node"
- Don't: "We help you leverage synergies to disrupt the AI space"
- Do: "An unaudited AI decision creates existential liability"
- Don't: "Our world-class solutions transform your business!"
- Do: "We build" / "We deploy" / "We transform"
- Don't: "We help you" (passive, weak)
- No exclamation marks. No startup jargon. Engineering tone.

# Directives

SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) written in Markdown.

Each directive defines:
- **Goal** — What needs to be accomplished
- **Inputs** — What data/context is required
- **Tools/Scripts** — Which `execution/` scripts to use
- **Outputs** — Expected deliverables
- **Edge Cases** — Known pitfalls and how to handle them

Directives are living documents — update them as you learn.
